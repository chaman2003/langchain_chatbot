## Features
- Interactive command-line interface for user input.
- Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate responses.
- Handles API errors and user input gracefully.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI Python library
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot_project.git
   cd chatbot_project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

4. **Set up your OpenAI API key:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API key:
     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
     ```

## File Structure
```
chatbot_project/
│
├── app.py              # Main application file
├── .env                # Environment variables (include your OpenAI API key)
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Usage
1. **Run the chatbot application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the chatbot:**
   - You will see a welcome message. Type your queries and press Enter.
   - Type `exit` to end the conversation.

## Example Interaction
```
Welcome to the chatbot! Type 'exit' to end the conversation.
You: hi
Chatbot response: Hello! How can I assist you today?
You: how are you?
Chatbot response: I'm just a program, but I'm here to help you!
```

## Error Handling
The application includes error handling for various situations:
- **API Rate Limit Exceeded**: If you exceed your API usage limits, the chatbot will inform you.
- **General Errors**: Any other errors during the API call will also be handled gracefully.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter the error `You exceeded your current quota`, check your OpenAI account for usage limits and consider upgrading your plan.
- Ensure your API key is correct and has permissions to access the Chat API.
